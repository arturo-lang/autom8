## At A Glance

Let's dive into some Autom8 script (yep, that is all you need to set it up!):

```red
; Sample project
; for converting a series of User data files
; into HTML pages

verbose: true

rules: [
    ".art$" # [
        title: "Processing files"

        target:   $[f][append f -- extract.extension f ".html"]
        template: "template.html"
    ]
]
```

## Try Autom8!

### Pre-built binaries

Autom8 already comes in ready-to-run binaries for Linux & macOS (more on the way).

Feel free to check out the [Releases](https://github.com/arturo-lang/autom8/releases) section yourself!

### Installation

To install local, first you have to have installed the latest version of [Arturo](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo).

Then, just clone this repo and simply go to the folder via your terminal.


#### As a Library

After having installed the latest version of Arturo, you can use Autom8 from any Arturo script as a library.

#### As a Standalone tool

Of course, you can also run Autom8 as a tool on it own:

```
autom8 <file path> (--at:destination) (--config:configuration)
```


Community

In case you want to ask a question, suggest an idea, or practically anything related to Autom8 (or Arturo) - feel free! Everything and everyone is welcome.

For that, the most convenient place for me would be the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/arturo-lang/autom8/issues) page.
