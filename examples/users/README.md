What is this?
====

This is a sample project for autom8, consisting of 3 + 1 parts:
- The main logic (`config.art`) - what to do with which files and how
- One template to use (`template.html`)
- A tree of data files (`data`)
- The result folder (`_out`) where our data ends up after being processed

How to run?
====

```bash
autom8 <path to this folder>
```

and that's it! :)
